# Crypto_Mario
Mario for crypto freaks using the Kaboom.js library
Games are the best way to learn something new. Tried playing with Kaboom to help people learn about Bitcoin.

### Rules
1. The Mario earn Bitcoins only by a mining rig.
2. Not your key, not your coins - Make sure to earn the private key in order to earn Bitcions and improve your score.
3. Beware of the banks.
4. Beware of the fossil fuel mining in the third level.

The game has three basic levels with easy difficulty. If you manage to clear all the three levels -  CONGRATULATIONS!! YOU BECOME A HODLER

### How to Play?
You can only play on a desktop/laptop - https://yathartharora.github.io/Crypto_Mario/
